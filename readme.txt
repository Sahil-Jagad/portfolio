--Readme document for *author*--

A reminder on academic integrity, as described in the syllabus.

In general, the course staff expects that you will look at code and examples from many online resources as part of the assignments, particularly to resolve syntax and understand frameworks. We expect that you'll use other libraries you find, and will even require it in some assignments. These practices are often critical to the work of developers today. The best developers are adept at interpreting the examples they see, customizing them to their specific situation, and citing their sources so they can find them later. We expect you to do the same.

While learning from examples is encouraged, attempting to pass an existing project or example from the web as your own is not allowed. If you ever have a question about what is or is not appropriate, feel free to ask the course staff!

Talking to classmates about class material, assignment requirements, etc. is a great way to verify ideas and get feedback. But this distinctly does *not* permit attempting to pass off someone elseâ€™s code as your own. Talking over ideas and approaches is allowed, but the work that you produce and submit must be your own.
